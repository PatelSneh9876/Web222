            <p>1. Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean?<br> 
                Responsive design is a means of building a website in such a way that its content and elements automatically adjust to match the screen size on which it is viewed.
                It prevents visuals from being wider than the screen width and saves mobile users from having to perform additional work to grasp the information.
                Responsive design websites use X and Y coordinates on a grid for layout and mathematical percentages for images instead of fixed-width settings. Using percentages rather than fixed-width parameters in
                a grid pattern produces a more fluid layout that adapts to the size of the display.<br>

            </p>
            <p>2. How does responsive design relate to web technologies?<br>
                The same HTML structure is supplied to all devices, however the CSS utilised varies based on screen width and/or orientation. 
                The numerous CSS rules utilised result in layout changes that make the material more accessible without obstacles like as horizontal scrolling, zoom issues, and information being cut off. 
                The idea is to minimise development time by not creating and coding separate webpages for each viewing device. This will make it easier to maintain the code base and add new features over time.
                CSS 5's media queries are crucial for this versatility. Media query rules can be adjusted to fit each new device that is introduced. Combining media queries and flexible grids to create flowing columns and pictures.

            </p>
            <p>3. What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your
                research?<br>
                Starting with the mobile layout is the best way to create a web app layout. It is usually simpler to use a single column layout, which is most common for small devices like smartphones. 
                Then, when the screen size of each larger device rises, add queries to modify the layout. This approach will make the generated code easier to comprehend.
                Furthermore, property values should be stated in relative units such as percent or rem to allow for quick changes to all of the values at once if necessary. The usage of div components as containers for content like as photographs allows for simple resizing for different screen widths.
                This adaptability may be achieved through the use of grid or flex.
                </p>
                
            <p>4. Finally, describe your learning experience in the course.<br>
                The concepts were straightforward to grasp. I realise that the only way to perfect it to the level of output is to practise it again. 
                Because there are so many different ways, the flexibility of JS made it tough to get things done precisely at first. 
                The C/C++ programming languages are vastly different. The built-in approaches are quite useful since they do not require any other libraries or modules.
